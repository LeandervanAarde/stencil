### Login and Sign up / Authentication
Each user on Stencil has their own profile from which they can view, judge and add entries!

### Hurry up before time runs out!
Competitions have a limited time and only one winner! So hurry up :0

### Tinder like swiping
Stencil has incorporated a voting system similiar to the tinder swipe, left for no and right for yes, If you like it, right it!

*   Competitions
    * tattoing has a wide variety of styles, each competition is created for a style to show off the unique aspects of that style and how you interpret it.
    * Competitions have a leaderboard, meaning you can always stay up to date with whose on top!
*  View and update your profile
    * Give your profile some flare with an image, username and contact details, if someone likes what you do, they can call or email you

### Choose your role
On sign up users can select a role between artist or Enthusiast, this means that if an artist has something you want they can contact you and vice versa

### Pretty damn secure!
Firebase handles all security needed for the application, feel safe!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process
The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. <br>

The goal of this application was to create an experience that felt personalised to each user to some extent, making it as clean as possible.  Considering the limit time constraint I was limited to my MVP (minimal viable product), I wanted to build an application which I could expand on if I needed to while learning the fundamentals of React Native. 
<br> 
Throughout the conceptual process of this application , I wanted to create an application that really looks good and works well, this project was more focus on design considering that firebase did a lot of the heavy lifting for me. I wanted to focus on less components and considering the reusability of components more. I learned a lot about Firebase and react Native.


### Ideation

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

####    Front end Implementation

* Implementation of Context for globally accessible data. 
* If statements to ensure application doesnt break
* Gesture handler to make voting more pleasureable too the user. 
* View your own profile and ammount of wins that you have 
* Filter entries based on whether you have voted on it or not

#### Firebase implementation
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Users:
    * Users are able to create an account or delete an account
    * users can reset their email if needed
    * Personalise your account and add information about yourself. 

* Competitions:
    * Enter yourself into a competition of your choosing! Upload an image to firestore storage and information to firestore. 
    * When users delete account, their entries get deleted
    * Each competition has ONE winnner, not a winner accross the board.


#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
*  My largerst challenge throughout this project was the card swiping, learning more about React Native and ReactNative Animated, the way things are implemented make sense after reading and following tutorials , but I love the implementation.
* Firebase, I had to learn a lot about firebase and BAS, using things such as Promise.all() has really helped me in using firebase and getting data. Firebase has been a challenge due to my comfort with MONGODB , Express and Node. This is however a good thing.
* There are a few bugs throughout the application, I aam always looking to learn more about programming and how the internals work on certain things. I do think that building a project of this size takes longer than 8 weeks, furthermore I think that no project is perfect the first time round and thats why updates are a regular thing, however, I am proud of the project none the less


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* I really enjoy working with React Native, its a great platform and moving away from web was a really nice change.
* One click deployment of the project is a definite Highlight considering that I was able to deploy a project that I am proud of and still want to continue working on going forward. 

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Reset competitions, reset entries and find winner of each competition running all at once. 
* Cards that swipe with gesture handler and Animated. 
* Filtering of data depending of what the users want to see. 
* Call or email users. 
* Push notification code implemented, but not used. Will come through if function is called.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
* I want to fix all the bugs in the application and improve my context
* I would like to give the ability to make a competition. 

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
